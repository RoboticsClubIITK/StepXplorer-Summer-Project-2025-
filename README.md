# StepXplorer-Summer-Project-2025-
 The StepXplorer project was undertaken as part of the Robotics Club, IIT Kanpurâ€™s summer projects,
 with the goal of developing a stair-climbing robot capable of navigating vertical steps using an innovative
 mechanical design. Unlike traditional legged robots, our approach relies on a wheeled rotating mechanism
 that enables the robot to climb over small steps through controlled motion and stability. Staircases pose
 a unique challenge for mobile robots, especially when operating in environments designed primarily for
 humans.
 Our project aimed to address this gap by designing a compact, Arduino-controlled robot that can climb
 stairs using precise actuation and minimal electronics. The project emphasized hands-on learning in
 mechanical design, control systems, and embedded programming. Through iterative design and testing,
 the team explored multiple climbing mechanisms,tuned motor control algorithms. This documentation
 outlines the motivation, design method- ology, control logic, challenges encountered, and outcomes of
 the SteXplorer project.
 The secondary objective of our project was to develop a self-balancing platform that maintains the
 payload surface in a vertical orientation at all times, using servo motors for active stabilization.
